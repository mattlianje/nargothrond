Nargothrond is named after the Elven fortress of Finrod Felagund and includes [instructions](https://nargothrond.xyz/notes-web-server.html) for setting up your own bastion on the web.

> "Thus Finrod came to the Caverns of Narog, and began to establish there deep halls and armouries after the fashion of the mansions of Menegroth; and that stronghold was called Nargothrond."
> ― J.R.R. Tolkien, Quenta Silmarillion
